//Criteria:
//When I click the start button, a timer starts 
    //add button and eventListener to start timer
//When I answer a question, then I am presented with another question
   //User Interactions prompt the next question
//If an answer is incorrect, time is subtracted from the timer
     //compare an array (answers) and store the data (score)
//The quiz ends if all the questions are answered or the timer ends
    //after x amount answers (this could end the timer) or time runs out, the application ends
// people who have made it to the end of the quiz can leave their initials
    //store and compare answers given and an array of correct answers and then place in a table of possible spots and allow the user to leave initials

    //start with one question and then go on to the next
    //I think maybe switching between pages for questions?
    //set onclick event with if correct or incorrect answers
    //maybe a boolean? correct = true, incorrect = false?
    //set id for correct and a different one for wrong

    //example: const rightAnswer = document.querySelector('#right-answer');
    //rightAnswer.addEventListener('click')

    //object might be easier than an array

    //const questionArray = [ {
    //question: 'What is the best food?'
    //option: ['tacos', 'sushi', 'borsh', 'hamburgers']
    //answer: 0
    //}
    //];

    //<section>
    //<h1 id ='question'></h1>
    //<ul id='options'>
    //</ul>

//function renderQuestion (question) {
//     const questionEl = document.querySelector('#question');
//     questionEl.textContent= question.text;

//     question.options.array.forEach(handleOption
//         const liEl = document.create
//     })
